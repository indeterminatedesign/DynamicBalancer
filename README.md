# DynamicBalancer
I came up with a design for a 3D printed Dynamic Spin Balancer using an ESP32, an MPU6050 and a hall sensor to help balance out my wheels.  Hopefully you all find it useful and maybe someone out there can take the development even further.

The design is fairly simple, I recommend watching my Youtube video.  Everything is printed out of PLA with the exception of the isolators which are TPU.  On the isolators I recommend 2 walls and ~10% infill.
