# TinyMPU6050

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gabriel-milan/TinyMPU6050.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gabriel-milan/TinyMPU6050)


Inspired by [tockn's library](https://github.com/tockn/MPU6050_tockn) simplicity and ease of use, this implementation focuses on performance and accuracy while still being lightweight.

You're more than welcome to collaborate!

## Warning
While in calibration mode, *DO NOT MOVE* the sensor.

## Disclaimer
- Temperature isn't covered by this library (my personal choice);
